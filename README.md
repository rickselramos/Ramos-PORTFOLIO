Reflection

Building my portfolio site felt tough yet rewarding in itself. As a beginner, I faced plenty of challenges, especially while adding text and pictures. I did not think GitHub was so picky. Minor errors, such as mistyping file names or missing folders, created huge errors, and I went through endless cycles of trial and error, just to find a way to fix them. Each late night, I was trying to figure out what went wrong—analyzing what was missing, what had not loaded, and what had to be tweaked. Though many times I felt like giving up, I kept on fighting and made it happen on the output I wanted. The Skills section was particularly challenging. I resized images and aligned labels to achieve a clean and balanced look. CSS grid and flexbox came in handy to resolve layout issues, and I tested the site under both desktop and mobile devices for responsiveness. 
The other important thing for me was learning about accessibility: adding alt texts to images, using a good contrast ratio, and employing semantic HTML tags such as <h1>, <h2>, and <p>. It was tough, but I am proud of what I built because it shows what I have put in and how I have grown as a student. 
For future improvements, I want to add things such as contact forms, some hover effects, and maybe simple animations to make the site dynamic. I also want to look up JavaScript for some functionality improvement. The layout and the content will be further refined to make this site clean, responsive, and true to my story. This taught me a lot-not just about coding but also about persistence and learning through action.
